## Project Analytics

Track how many people view your projects and which ones attract the most attention. This data helps you understand what types of work resonate with your audience.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
// Example: Fetching project data
const getProjects = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/projects');
  const projects = await response.json();
  return projects.map(project => ({
    title: project.title,
    technologies: project.technologies,
    description: project.description
  }));
};
```
  ```python
def get_project_details(project_id):
    project = Project.query.get(project_id)
    return {
        'title': project.title,
        'technologies': project.technologies,
        'description': project.description,
        'github_url': project.github_url
    }
```
</CodeGroup>

## Collaboration Features
